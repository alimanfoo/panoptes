NameSingle: fractional genotype
NamePlural: fractional genotypes
Description: A table of read counts

ColumnDataTable: variants            # The 1D data table where each entry corresponds to a column
ColumnIndexField: SnpName            # The column name in ColumnDataTable that maps into ColumnIndexArray, note that "AutoKey" can be used if your rows do not have Unique IDs
ColumnIndexArray: col_index          # 1D Array in HDF5 that gives the value of ColumnIndexField for each column,
                                     # if this is missing then it is assumed that the HDF5 columns are in the same
                                     # order as the "ColumnDataTable" sorted by "ColumnIndexField"

RowDataTable: samples                # The 1D data table where each entry corresponds to a row
RowIndexField: ID                    # The column name in RowDataTable that maps into RowIndexArray, note that "AutoKey" can be used if your rows do not have Unique IDs
RowIndexArray: row_index             # 1D Array in HDF5 that gives the value of RowIndexField for each row
                                     # if this is missing then it is assumed that the HDF5 rows are in the same
                                     # order as the "RowDataTable" sorted by "RowIndexField"

FirstArrayDimension: row             # Either 'row' or 'column' to indicate the first dimension in the HDF5 array. Eg. array[1] == 'a row' or array[1] == 'a column'
