Description: A table containing a number of samples "Line 2"

Icon: fa-flask

# The primary key column ID for this table. This should correspond to a column in data containing a unique value for each record
# Optionally, this parameter can be set to 'AutoKey' to instruct the software to automatically generate a primary key
PrimKey: key


# The following list of properties will be used by some tools that allow the user to quickly find a (set of) item(s)
QuickFindFields: key,Site_ID,SampleTypeID

DisableSubsets: true #If this flag is set, there will be no subsets option for this dataset


# The following lists all the columns in the data files, and tells Panoptes how to interpret them as properties of the data items
# NOTE: Optionally, "AutoScanProperties=true" can be used to instruct Panoptes to automatically import all datatable columns
# Both mechanisms can be combined: further settings can still be specified for individual properties

# The following block declares that this datatable contains a genome values for each item in the table
# Panoptes will process these using the multiresolution filterbanking, and the user can display these as tracks in the genome browser
