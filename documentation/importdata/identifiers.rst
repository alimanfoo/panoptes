.. _data-import-identifiers:

Valid data identifiers
-----------------------

Many identifiers used in the source data structures (resource identifiers, file and folder names, table column headers, etc..),
are directly mapped to identifiers in the database tables.
Therefore, they should be formatted as standard variable names:

- Do not contain dashes, white spaces or other special characters.
- Do not start with a number.
