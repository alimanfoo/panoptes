Data import settings
--------------------

Most source data resources have settings that are specified through a YAML_ definition file.
Using the admin web frontend, these settings can be edited by clicking the |buttonedit| icon,
left of the label that identifies a source data resource.


.. Note::
  The sample dataset **Samples_and_Variants** contains settings files that are fully commented,
  and can serve as a starting point to explore the possible options.
  Additional comments are provided in other datasets as well, wherever concepts are introduced
  that are not present in this dataset.
