Panoptes
============================

Panoptes is a web application for exploration and visualisation of
data. Many of the features, such as querying and browsing tables, are
generic and can be used with any kind of data. There are also some
specialised features for genomic and geospatial data.

.. caution::
 Panoptes is still in an early stage of development. It should currently be considered as a prototype, unfit for production deployments.

We welcome early adopters,
however please bear in mind that the design and configuration of the web
application are still in flux and may change substantially. As our current
focus is on developing the code, we can only offer limited support.  For
more information about the project please send an email to the public
mailing list <panoptes-dev@googlegroups.com>.
