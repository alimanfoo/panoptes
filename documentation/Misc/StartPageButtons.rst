Start page buttons
------------------

Button icon
...........
A icon for a start page button can be defined in two ways:

- Use an icon name from the list of icons found at http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons.
- Use a bitmap name from the directory https://github.com/cggh/panoptes/tree/master/webapp/Bitmaps/CustomButtonBitmaps.
  Do not include the ``.png`` extension in the name.
  (Note: you can add and use extra bitmaps in this folder on a local deployment)
