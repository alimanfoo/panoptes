Panoptes
========

Panoptes is a web application for exploration and visualisation of
data. Many of the features, such as querying and browsing tables, are
generic and can be used with any kind of data. However, there are
currently also some specialised features for genomic and geospatial
data.

For more information about the project please send an email to the public
mailing list <panoptes-dev@googlegroups.com>.
