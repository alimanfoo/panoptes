Panoptes is a web application for exploration and visualisation of
data, with special focus on genomic data. It includes:

* Querying, sorting, plotting and templatised views of tabular data
* Fast genome browser with tracks from the tables, including numerical, categorical and regional
* Genotype viewer
* Map geographic data
* Tree viewer

All these elements are integrated to allow swift user-journeys through the data.
